### Goodreads parser

This is a simple parser for goodreads.com.
It parses daily my bookshelf via github actions and creates/updates `data/books.json` file with all books read.
Also, it creates/updates `data/top_rated.json` file with top rated books (4-5 stars).

I'll use this file someday in my blog.
